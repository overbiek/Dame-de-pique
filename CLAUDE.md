# Dame de Pique

Custom online multiplayer Hearts variant. Node.js/Express/Socket.io backend
+ single-file HTML/CSS/JS frontend. Deployed on Railway, auto-deploys on
push to the connected branch.

## Files
- `server.js` — game engine, socket handlers, AI, auth endpoints
- `db.js` — Postgres layer (accounts, sessions, stats). Only active if
  `DATABASE_URL` is set; the app degrades gracefully to guest-only play
  without it — never assume a DB is present without checking.
- `public/index.html` — entire frontend in one file (inline `<style>` +
  `<script>`, no build step)
- `package.json` — express, socket.io, pg, bcryptjs

## Custom ruleset
- +10 per trick won; hearts subtract face value (2♥=-2 .. A♥=-14); Q♠=-26
- A single trick can therefore never score above +10 — that's correct,
  not a bug, if it comes up again
- Shooting the moon (all hearts + Q♠ in one round) replaces that round's
  score entirely: shooter +60, everyone else -20
- 16 rounds; pass cycle Left→Right→Across→Keep (rounds 4/8/12/16 = Keep,
  no passing)
- The opening card of trick 1 each round can't be a heart or Q♠

## AI (in server.js)
- `heuristicChoose` — fast rule-based policy; also used as the rollout
  policy inside Monte Carlo simulations
- `aiChoose` — the actual live decision. Samples plausible opponent hands
  via `sampleWorld` (respecting proven voids + passing certainty),
  simulates each candidate card to the end of the round, plays whichever
  averages best
- `applyHardRules` — a hard pre-filter run before Monte Carlo (play-time
  only), so these are guaranteed, not just statistically favored: never
  lead hearts>5 unless every lower heart is already played; never lead
  or overtake spades with A/K while Q♠ is still unaccounted for (not
  held, not captured) unless it's the closing card of a trick that
  provably can't contain her; always lead a held A♦/A♣ on trick 1.
  `heuristicChoose`'s leading branch mirrors the same "don't lead
  A♠/K♠ while she's still out there" restriction independently, since
  it's also used as the Monte Carlo rollout policy and as the
  exception-fallback for the live decision — both bypass
  `applyHardRules` entirely
- `aiSelectPass` — its own hard filter, `neverPass`: never pass
  clubs≤J, hearts≤5, or spades≤J (the low/mid spades are the guards
  that let a spade lead be ducked instead of scooping the queen).
  Overridden by `mustPass`: a club or diamond down to a single card is
  forced into the outgoing pass even though it's otherwise protected —
  going fully void in that suit outweighs keeping the one card, since
  every future lead in it becomes a free dump for a heart or Q♠
- Order matters in `heuristicChoose`'s leading branch — the trick-1 ace
  check must come before the spade-hunting ("chase mode") check, or
  chase mode fires first and the ace rule never triggers

## Accounts & stats (needs DATABASE_URL — Railway Postgres plugin)
- Username/password, bcrypt-hashed, session tokens
- Stats tracked live per account: games played/finished, best/worst
  single trick, best/worst round, best/worst game, total moons shot,
  most moons in one game
- `trackStat()` retries 3x with backoff on failure — this fixed a real
  production data-loss bug (silent dropped writes to Railway's DB), keep
  it

## Known placeholders (UI exists, no backend yet)
- Ranked Multiplayer tile
- Rank leaderboard tile

## Not implemented
- Password reset (no email service configured)

## Testing convention
- Copy `server.js` → `server.test.js`, sed the AI/round `setTimeout`
  delays down to ~5ms for fast local iteration; delete before shipping
- Test `db.js` against a real local Postgres instance, not a mock
  (`apt-get install postgresql` works fine in a sandboxed environment)
- Frontend logic: load `index.html` in jsdom, extract the inline
  `<script>`, and `eval` it — but it starts with `"use strict"`, which
  gives `eval` its own scope, so nothing attaches to `window` by
  default. Append an explicit `window.__t = { ... }` export block to the
  same eval'd string to expose what needs testing
- Delete all test files and `node_modules` before considering a change
  finished
